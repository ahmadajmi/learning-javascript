# Notes on [JavaScript Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596806767.do) By Stoyan Stefanov

## CHAPTER 1 Introduction

### JavaScript

 - Doesn't have classes
 - Functions are first class objects

A function is an instance of the Object type:

``` javascript
// Function can be stored in a variable

var initFunc = function initFunc(){}

initFunc instanceof Object;// true

// Function can have properties

initFunc.foo = 'foo';

initFunc.foo; // foo

// Has a link to the constructor
initFunc.constructor;

// Can be passed as a parameter to another function
```

Higher-order function :: a function that does at least one of the following

 - Takes one or more functions as an input
 - Outputs a function

Patterns

In software development, a pattern is a solution to a common problem. A pattern is not necessarily a code solution ready for copy-and-paste but more of a best practice, a useful abstraction, and a template for solving categories of problems.

Antipattern

An anti-pattern is not the same as a bug or a coding error; itâ€™s just a common approach that causes more problems than it solves.

Importance of Design Patterns

 - Write better code using best practice.
 - A mean of abstraction without dive in details.
 - Improve communication between teamwork.

None Objects in javascript (premitive types)

		Number
		String
		Boolean
		null
		undefined

Number, String & Boolean have corresponding object representation in the form of primitive wrappers and could be converted either by the programmer or by JS interpreter behind the scene.

Functions are objects so they can have properties and methods

``` javascript
function foo(){}

foo.name = 90;

foo.name; // 90

foo.square = function(x) {
	return x * x;
}

foo.square(9); // 81
```

When defining a variable, it will becomes a property of the global object, also the variable will have properties (attributes).

``` javascript
var variable = 'variable';

// has some properties (attributes)
variable.length;

// Can be accessed from the global object
window.variable;
```


#### What is Object

Simply it's a collection of names properties, a list of key-value pairs, properties could be functions (methods)

``` javascript
var object = {
	name: 'Adham',
	sayHello: function(message) {
		return message + ' ' + this.name;
	}
};

object.name; // Adham

object.sayHello('Hello'); //Hello Adham
```


### JavaScript Objects types

#### Native

Described in the ECMAScript standard. Can be categorised as built in objects like Date . Array . or user-defined ( var o = {}; )

#### Host

Defined by the host environment (for example, the browser environment). Like window and all DOM objects

### Classes in JavaScript

Simply NO classes in JS, but all you want is objects.

[Inheritance VS compositions in JavaScript]( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8696695/composition-inheritance-and-aggregation-in-javascript)

### Prototype
A prototype is an object and every created function automatically gets a prototype property that points to a new blank object and it's constructor property will point to the function that just created not the built-in Object().

``` javascript
function func() {}

func.prototype; // func {}

func.prototype.constructor; // func()
```

### Strict Mode

Makes code simple and less errors.
strict mode is backward compatible that means code will work in older browsers that doesn't support it without raising errors becuse theses browsers will read it as a normal string.

We can put it as `use strict` string in the code scope (function scope or global scope).

Strict Mode https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode


### Things that will hurt your feelings

[JSlint](http://www.jslint.com/)

[JShint](http://www.jshint.com/)

### The console

The console object is not part of the language but is considered part of the environment (host object).

``` javascript
console.log();
```

`log()` is a method of the console object which prints all the parameters passed to it.
`dir()` enumerates the object passed to it and prints all properties, this is very useful to see what's inside the object in a structured way.

type the following code in firebug or the Chrome Dev tools to see it better

``` javascript
var obj = {
	name: 'name',
	age: '90',
	anotherObj: {
		foo: 'foo'
	}
};

console.log(obj);

// Object { name="name", age="90", anotherObj={...}}

console.dir(obj);

// name "name"
// age "90"
// anotherObj Object { foo="foo"}
```

If you have installed nodejs you can write code in your terminal simply by typing `node` command and then you will enter the node environment.


## CHAPTER 2 Essentials

### Maintainable code means code that:

- Is readable
- Is consistent
- Is predictable
- Looks as if it was written by the same person
- Is documented

### Minimizing Globals

Variables declared inside a function scope are considered local to that function and not accessible outside it. So global variables are those who declared outside the function or declared without using the `var` keyword inside of the function.

For every global variable created it will be attached to the global environment object, in the browser this global object is `window` or `this`.

``` javascript
global = "I'm the global variable";

// All the output will return => I'm the global variable
console.log(global);
console.log(window.global);
console.log(this.global);
```

``` javascript
function names() {
  global = 'global';
  var local = 'local';
}

names();

global; // global
local;  // undefined
```

So the point here is always use the `var` keyword in declaring variables and stay away from globals.


#### Problems with global variables

- Shared on all the code base
- Are all on the global object and can make conflicts with other name from other third party plugin.

### Using `delete` to delete variables

- variables declared using the `var` keyword can't be deleted.
- Variables created in the global can be deleted, this is because they are properties of the global object.

``` javascript
var global = 'global';

global_novar = 'global_novar';

(function(){
	global_inside_func = 'global_inside_func';
})();

// when trying to delete this in `strict mode` it will throw error.
delete global; // false

delete global_novar; // true

delete global_inside_func; // true

```

#### The global Object

#### Single var pattern
