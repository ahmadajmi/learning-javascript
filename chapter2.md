## CHAPTER 2 / Essentials

### Maintainable code means code that:

- Is readable
- Is consistent
- Is predictable
- Looks as if it was written by the same person
- Is documented

### Minimizing Globals

Variables declared inside a function scope are considered local to that function and not accessible outside it. So global variables are those who are declared outside the function or declared without using the `var` keyword inside of the function.

For every global variable created it will be attached to the global environment object, in the browser this global object is `window` or `this`.

``` javascript
global = "I'm the global variable";

// All the output will return => I'm the global variable
console.log(global);
console.log(window.global);
console.log(this.global);
```

``` javascript
function names() {
  global = 'global';
  var local = 'local';
}

names();

global; // global
local;  // undefined
```

So the point here is always use the `var` keyword in declaring variables and stay away from globals.


#### Problems with global variables

- Shared on all the code base
- Are all on the global object and can make conflicts with other name from other third party plugin.

### Using `delete` operator

- variables declared using the `var` keyword can't be deleted, because it's non-configurable meaning they can't be removed from the global object using the delete operator.
- Variables created without the `var` keyword can be deleted, this is because they are properties of the global object.

``` javascript
x = 'this is x'; // creates the property x on the global object
var y = 'this is y'; // creates the property x on the global object as as non-configurable

// x is a property of the global object and can be deleted
delete x; // true

// y is a property of the global object and can't be deleted
delete y; // false
```

More info about [delete operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete)

#### Single var pattern

Single var pattern can be used at the top of functions for using one `var` statement to declare multiple variables by commas and hase some benefits:

- Provide a single place for declaring function variables.
- Help to avoid the hoisting problem.
- Help to minimize global variables.
- Less code.

``` javascript
function getUserInfo() {
  var name = 'Ahmad',
      email = 'ahmad@email.com',
      address = {};
}
```

It's also a good practise to declare initial value to variables as seen in the above `address` object, this can increase code readability.

#### Hoisting
Javascript always consider a variable as declared even it's used before the var declaration.

``` javascript
function hoist() {
  console.log(foo); // undefined
  var foo = 'foo';
  console.log(foo); // foo
}

hoist();
```

So it's always best practice to declare variables first in the function scope.


#### for Loops

One way to make for Loops more speed and increase the performance is to cache the length of the array (collection) you are iterating over, so instead of doing something like this

``` javascript
var arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6];

for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
}
```

We can do this

``` javascript
var arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6];

for (var i = 0, length = arr.length; i < length; i += 1) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
}
```

This way we iterate the array length only once and then use it during the loop, this is useful especially when we are trying to iterate over large number of DOM collections.


#### for-in Loops

for-in Loops used to loop over none array objects and it's called enumeration.
for-in Loops can be used to loop over arrays but it's not recommended.

When iterating over Object's it's always recommend to use the `hasOwnProperty()` method so we can filter the properties that can come from the prototype chain. Consider the following example.

``` javascript
var object = {
  name: 'Name',
  email: 'mail@gmail.com'
};

Object.prototype.newMethod = function() {
  return 'prototype chain';
};

object.newMethod(); // prototype chain

for (i in object) {
  console.log(object[i]);
}

// =>

// Name
// mail@gmail.com
// function()

```

So as you can see the `newMethod()` method becomes a property of our created object because it inherits it from the prototype chain, so whenever we loop over `object` the `newMethod()` method will be returned as a property. to avoid this you can use the `hasOwnProperty()` method to filter the result and return only the `object` main properties.

``` javascript
for (i in object) {
  if (object.hasOwnProperty(i)) {
  console.log(object[i]);
  }
}

// Name
// mail@gmail.com
```

#### Augmenting Built-in Prototypes

Confused about this shit especially when it comes to a question like [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1372829/javascript-augmenting-basic-types-prototype-inheritance-doubt). Will investigate more time on it.


#### switch Pattern

The author suggested some rules to increase the readability of the switch Pattern.

- Aligning each case with switch (an exception to the curly braces indentation rule).
- Indenting the code within each case.
- Ending each case with a clear `break;`.
- Avoiding [fall-throughs](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/188461/switch-statement-fallthrough-should-it-be-allowed) (when  you omit the break intentionally). If you're absolutely convinced that a fall-through is the best approach, make sure you document such cases, because they might look like errors to the readers of your code.
- Ending the switch with a default: to make sure there’s always a sane result even if none of the cases matched.

``` javascript
var name = 'Ahmad', result;

switch(name) {
case 'Ahmad':
  result = 'Ahmad';
  break;
case 'foo':
  result = 'foo';
  break;
default:
  result = 'default';
}

result;
```

#### Typecast

Always use the the strict equality operator (===) to compare between two values instead of using the equality operator ==, this will prevent JS from implicitly convert types.

``` javascript
var zero = 0;
0 == false; // true :)
0 === false; // false :(
```
[Implicit data type conversion in JavaScript when comparing integer with string using ==](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7625144/implicit-data-type-conversion-in-javascript-when-comparing-integer-with-string-u).

#### Avoiding eval()

Just avoid it.


#### Number Conversions with parseInt()

`parseInt()` functions is used to convert a string to integer.

``` javascript
parseInt("abc");     // Returns NaN.
parseInt("12abc");   // Returns 12.
```

The function accepts a second parameter called radix and it should be specified and if not strings with a prefix of '0x' are considered hexadecimal.

### Coding Conventions

#### Indentation

Always consider making a decision on code indentation. This will help you and your team. Personally I use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/).

#### Curly Braces

Always use them even with a single statement in a for loop

``` javascript
// bad practice
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 1)
  alert(i);
```

``` javascript
// better
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) {
  alert(i);
}
```

#### Opening Brace Location

Always use curly braces and always put the opening one on the same line, for example


``` javascript
// Bad

// This function will return undefined :).
// this is becuse the semicolon insertion mechanism in JS that will insert semicolon at the end of the return

function curly() {
  return
  {
    name: 'name'
  };
}

// The preceding code is equivalent to this one

function curly() {
  return undefined;
  // this code is not reachable
  {
    name: 'name'
  };
}

// Good
function curly() {
  return {
    name: 'name'
  };
}
```

Always use semicolon and don't trust JS to implicitly insert it for you.

#### Naming Conventions

Choosing a consistent naming for variables and functions

- Capitalizing Constructors

To make it easy to see the difference between a normal and a constructor function always capitalize the constructor function name.

``` javascript
var person = new Person();
```

- Separating Words
For function and method names you can use lower camel case, for example


``` javascript
getFirstName()
```

For variable names use lowercase words delimited by commas

``` javascript
first_name
last_name
```

So this helps you distinguish between functions and other identifiers.

If you have such a constant variable (JS have no constants), you can adopt a convention by using all-caps for naming variables.

``` javascript
var PI = 3.14;
last_name
```

In some cases some developers use `_` underscore prefix such as a convention for indicating a private function of method. It doesn't provide any privacy it's just a convention. [In Javascript, what does this underscore mean?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8288756/in-javascript-what-does-this-underscore-mean?lq=1).

#### Writing Comments

->  In this book we don't use many comments; we try to make our programs self-documenting by using descriptive names.

#### Writing API Docs

#### Peer Reviews

Try to peer review your code with your coworker, so you will get a feedback about making your code better and exchange knowledge and learn from each other.

#### Minify code in production

Minification is the process of eliminating white space, comments to decrease the size of the JavaScript that will be transfered from the server to the browser, this will help increase the performance.

[Minify files with UglifyJS](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify)

#### Use Lint tool

As mentioned before always use a lint to detect errors and potential problems in your JavaScript code. [JSlint](http://www.jslint.com/) or [JShint](http://www.jshint.com/)
